# Largest Island


  You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of potentially unequal height
  and width containing only 0s and 1s. Each
  1 represents water, and each 0 represents part of a
  land mass. A land mass consists of any number of 0s that are either
  horizontally or vertically adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent). The number
  of adjacent 0s forming a land mass determine its size.


  Note that a land mass can twist. In other words, it doesn't have to be a straight
  vertical line or a straight horizontal line; it can be L-shaped, for example.


  Write a function that returns the largest possible land mass size after
  changing exactly one 1 to a 0. Note that the given
  matrix will always contain at least one 1, and you may mutate
  the matrix.

**Sample Input**
matrix = [
  [0, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 0]
]

**Sample Output**
5 // Switching either matrix[1][2] or matrix[2][1]
// creates a land mass of size 5
