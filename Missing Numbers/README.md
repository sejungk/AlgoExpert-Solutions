# Missing Numbers

  
    You're given an unordered list of unique integers nums in the
    range [1, n], where n represents the length of
    nums + 2. This means that two numbers in this range are missing
    from the list.
  

  
    Write a function that takes in this list and returns a new list with the two
    missing numbers, sorted numerically.
  

  **Sample Input**
  nums = [1, 4, 3]
  **Sample Output**
  [2, 5]  // n is 5, meaning the completed list should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
